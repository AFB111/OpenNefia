- create() will try to create a new popup, if it is below the maximum.
- step() steps all popups by calling their step() coroutines and then yielding.
- clear() clears everything.
- popups must move as the screen scrolls.
- popups should fulfill an interface for providing the exact drawing function to use.
- the popup event should receive the exact contents of on_damaged, including changes by mods.
- if other damage things have been added then the damaged event should be modified before the callback to add the popup.
* Depends
- base for hooking into damage event
- NOT elona as it hooks into a more fundamental mechanic
