* Summary
Mod for enabling desired house board features.
* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC lua
HouseBoard.query()
HouseBoard.enabled_features(map)
HouseBoard.run_feature(id)
#+END_SRC
* Events
** Depends
(none)
** Adds
- house_board.on_use
  + features: array
  + map: Map
* Data
- house_board.feature
  + name: I18NFormatter
  + callback: function()
* Config
(none)
* Requirements
- Conditional enabling of features with event callback
- If no features returned, acts as disabled
- Does not actually provide the house board item, instead the on_use callback is expected to be implanted in the desired object
  + Only real reason is theming. It's weird to edit the chip for "house_board.house_board" when it should really be "elona.house_board".
* Depends
- base
